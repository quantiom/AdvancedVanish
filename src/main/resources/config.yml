#   - LuckPerms (recommended)
#   - bPermissions
#   - GroupManager
#
# To add the priority meta: (default is 0)
#   LuckPerms: /lp user/group <user|group> meta set meta.<meta-key> <priority-num>
#     (ex: /lp user quantiom meta set advancedvanish-priority 5)
#   bPermissions: (/user OR /group) meta <meta-key> <priority-num>
#     (ex: /user meta advancedvanish-priority 5)
#   GroupManager: Add the permission <meta-key>.<priority-num>, and AdvancedVanish will use the highest number
#     (ex: /manuaddp quantiom advancedvanish-priority.5)
